### Distributing Beads
- d1.	Player selects a house from his side of the board
- d2.	Player takes all beads from that house in his hand
- d3.	Starting from the next house, and in an anticlockwise manner, the player drops a bead from his hand into other houses without skipping any house
- d4 When player is done dropping all the beads in his hand. There are three things the player can do depending on the number of beads in the last house in which a bead was dropped
- If there is now 1 bead in the last house that a bead was dropped in, the player’s turn has ended, and the players can collect points if any
- If there are now 4 beads in the last house that a bead was dropped in, the player collects all four beads as points and his turn has ended
- If there is any other number of beads in the last house that a bead was dropped in, the player takes all beads from that house and repeats the distribution process from step d3

### Collecting points
-	If the last house a bead was dropped in has now has four beads. Collect all four beads as points and end player turn
-	After a player’s turn has ended, If any house has four beads on your side of the board, collect those four beads as points (applies to both players). The player who’s turn just ended collects points on his side first.
-	If there are only four beads left after a player has collected points, the player is to also collect those four beads left.

### Valid moves
-	There are valid moves left if there exists a house such that when you distribute from that house following the steps from d2, then there will still be at least one bead in the opponents other half.
-	A player is only allowed to make a move that violates the rule above if there are currently eight beads on the board
